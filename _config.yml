  A collection of articles, resources, random thoughts, quick notes,
  and everything and anything that I have learned or would like to expand
  my knowledge in. I like technology, artificial intelligence, decentralized systems,
  distributed knowledge, economics, philosophy and any possible intertwining
  of such subjects and ideas.
