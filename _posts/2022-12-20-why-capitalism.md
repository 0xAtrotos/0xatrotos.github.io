title: Why $Capitalism?
---
Capitalism is an economic system in which the means of production, such as factories and businesses, are privately owned and operated for profit. This system is based on the principles of supply and demand, and it is characterized by competition, innovation, and the freedom of individuals to pursue their own economic interests.

Capitalism is the ideal functional system for our society because it allows for economic freedom and individual initiative. This freedom, leads to innovation and growth, which in turn benefits society as a whole. Additionally, capitalism is seen as a more efficient system than alternatives such as socialism or communism, because it allows market forces to allocate resources in the most efficient way possible.

Furthermore, capitalism is often praised for its ability to create wealth and improve living standards. Because it is based on the pursuit of profit, capitalism incentivizes individuals and businesses to produce goods and services that people want and are willing to pay for. This can lead to increased productivity and a higher standard of living for society as a whole.

According to the principles of egoism, the best possible fitting economic system is capitalism because it is the only proposal which provides a greater good for everyone via selfish means.

Today we do not have an ideal capitalist system by any means. All systems around the world which are characterized as being capitalist, are actually just alternative manifestations of oligarchism masquerading as capitalist societies. True capitalist systems allow free movement of goods and money, and allows every individual to define for themselves what money is and how they wish to use it.
