#### Objectivism is a philosophical system developed by [Ayn Rand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand "Ayn Rand Wikipedia entry"). It is a form of egoism, the view that the pursuit of one's own self-interest is the highest moral good.

Objectivism holds that reality is objective, existing independently of our thoughts, beliefs, or feelings. This means that it can be known through reason, using our rational faculties such as observation and logic. According to objectivism, this allows for the possibility of objective knowledge.

One of the key principles of objectivism is the concept of individual rights. Objectivism holds that each individual has the right to life, liberty, and property, and that these rights are inalienable. This means that they cannot be taken away by anyone, including the government. Objectivists believe that the only moral principles are those that protect individual rights, and that any action that violates these rights is inherently wrong.

According to objectivism, the only way to achieve long-term happiness and fulfillment is to act on one's rational self-interest. This means that each individual should strive to achieve their own goals and pursue their own happiness, rather than sacrificing their own well-being for the sake of others. Objectivism holds that this approach to life is not only morally right, but also leads to the greatest overall well-being for society as a whole.

In summary, objectivism is a philosophical system that emphasizes the importance of individual rights and the pursuit of rational self-interest. It holds that reality is objective and can be known through reason, and that the only moral principles are those that protect individual rights. By following these principles, individuals can achieve long-term happiness and fulfillment, and contribute to the overall well-being of society.
