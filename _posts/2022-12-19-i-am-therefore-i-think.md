title: I am, therefore I think
---

As an objectivist, I believe that Ren√© Descartes' famous phrase "I think, therefore I am" implies a flawed understanding of the concept when viewed objectively. Rather than thinking creating one's existence, it could be argued that it is actually the opposite - one's existence allows for the ability to think. Without a physical form, there can be no thoughts or consciousness. This perspective suggests that consciousness and thought are not separate from the physical world, but rather are a product of the material being capable of experiencing them.

This understanding of the relationship between thought and existence has significant implications for how we comprehend the self and the world around us. If we view the fact of our own existence as the foundation for our thoughts and experiences, it shifts the focus from subjective internal mental states to the objective reality of the material world. It suggests that the self is not an isolated entity, but rather is closely connected to and influenced by the physical world and the body that exists within it.

Furthermore, this perspective aligns with my own objectivist philosophy, which holds that reality is objective and independent of one's consciousness or perceptions. According to this philosophy, the material world exists independently of one's thoughts and experiences, and it is the task of reason to discover the nature of this objective reality.

Objectivist philosophy emphasizes the importance of reason as the means of acquiring knowledge and understanding the world. It holds that reason is the highest human virtue, and that the use of reason is essential to living a happy and fulfilling life. Therefore, it is essential to approach concepts and ideas objectively and rationally, rather than relying on subjective feelings or internal mental states.

In line with this philosophy, considering the fact of one's own existence as the foundation for the ability to think and be conscious offers a more objective and scientifically grounded understanding of these concepts. The act of thinking is a result of one's existence, not the cause of it, and this understanding of the relationship between thought and existence does not rely on subjective experiences or internal mental states.

It is important to consider different viewpoints and be open to the possibility that our own perspectives may not be the only valid ones. However, as objectivists, it is essential to adhere to a rational and objective approach to these concepts and to seek out the truth based on reason and evidence. This is in contrast to other philosophical approaches that may prioritize subjective experiences or internal mental states over objective reality and reason.

In addition to the implications for how we understand the self and the world around us, this perspective on the nature of thought and consciousness also aligns with scientific understandings of the brain and consciousness. Science suggests that these phenomena are the result of complex neural activity and the functioning of the physical brain. It is the brain, a material organ within the body, that allows for the experience of consciousness and thought.

Overall, Descartes' famous phrase "I think, therefore I am" is a complex and multifaceted concept that can be interpreted in various ways. As objectivists, it is important to approach this concept and other philosophical ideas with a rational and objective mindset, seeking out the truth based on reason and evidence rather than subjective feelings or internal mental states.
