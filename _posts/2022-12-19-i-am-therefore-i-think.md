title: I am, therefore I think
---

Ren√© Descartes is well known for his famous phrase "I think, therefore I am," which suggests that his own existence is dependent on his ability to think. However, this formulation of the concept might be seen as backwards when viewed objectively.

Rather than suggesting that thinking is what creates one's existence, it could be argued that it is actually the other way around. It is the fact of one's existence that allows for the ability to think. Without a body or a physical form, there can be no thoughts or consciousness.

In other words, the act of thinking is a result of one's existence, not the cause of it. This understanding of the relationship between thought and existence could be seen as more objective, as it does not rely on subjective experiences or internal mental states.

Of course, this is just one perspective on the matter and there are many other ways to interpret Descartes' famous phrase. However, it is important to consider different viewpoints and to be open to the possibility that our own perspectives may not be the only valid ones. So, it is always important to be objective and consider all sides of an argument before coming to a conclusion.

The statement "I think, therefore I am" is often interpreted to mean that the act of thinking is what proves one's own existence. In other words, the fact that one is able to engage in the process of thinking is taken as evidence of one's own existence. But how would one get in the loop of thinking if they do indeed exist, if there was a possibility that they did not? Had they not existed, it would not be possible for the question "Do I exist?" to materialize.

Due to this, many philosophers have suggested that the statement could be understood as a statement of epistemic certainty. In this interpretation, the statement is not meant to be a proof of one's own existence, but rather a way of expressing the fact that one's own existence is the one thing that can be known with absolute certainty.

Another possible interpretation is that the statement is meant to be a statement about the nature of consciousness. In this interpretation, the statement is not meant to be a proof of one's own existence, but rather a way of highlighting the fact that consciousness and thought are inextricably linked. According to this interpretation, the fact that one is able to think is taken as evidence of the existence of consciousness or a "mind".

Descartes' statement is not a sufficient proof of one's own existence. Yours and my existence are simply a fact that can be experienced by both self and others, but can not be questioned by the self, as the act of questioning one's own existence nullifies the means by which that question came about.
