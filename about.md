It is not important who I am, and my true identity is not hidden. I use a pen-name online to add character to my online presence. The collections, resources, and notes on this site are for my own benefit, but if you find them helpful or amusing, please feel free to enjoy them.

### What does Atrotos mean?
In the Greek language, the word "atrotos" means "one who is invulnerable". Our universe and everything in it, including the matter and energy that make up our existence, has always existed and will continue to exist in some form or another. This is because matter and energy cannot be destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. Our existence, like the universe itself, is invulnerable to any known force. This should be our understanding of the universe and our place in it. Since something that cannot be destroyed does not need to be explained, our ideas and beliefs about the universe should be grounded in this concept of invulnerability.

## What is Objectivism?
Objectivism is a philosophical system developed by [Ayn Rand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand "Ayn Rand Wikipedia entry"). It is a form of egoism, the view that the pursuit of one's own self-interest is the highest moral good.

Objectivism holds that reality is objective, existing independently of our thoughts, beliefs, or feelings. This means that it can be known through reason, using our rational faculties such as observation and logic. According to objectivism, this allows for the possibility of objective knowledge.

One of the key principles of objectivism is the concept of individual rights. Objectivism holds that each individual has the right to life, liberty, and property, and that these rights are inalienable. This means that they cannot be taken away by anyone, including the government. Objectivists believe that the only moral principles are those that protect individual rights, and that any action that violates these rights is inherently wrong.

According to objectivism, the only way to achieve long-term happiness and fulfillment is to act on one's rational self-interest. This means that each individual should strive to achieve their own goals and pursue their own happiness, rather than sacrificing their own well-being for the sake of others. Objectivism holds that this approach to life is not only morally right, but also leads to the greatest overall well-being for society as a whole.

In summary, objectivism is a philosophical system that emphasizes the importance of individual rights and the pursuit of rational self-interest. It holds that reality is objective and can be known through reason, and that the only moral principles are those that protect individual rights. By following these principles, individuals can achieve long-term happiness and fulfillment, and contribute to the overall well-being of society.

### Why $Capitalism?
Capitalism is an economic system in which the means of production, such as factories and businesses, are privately owned and operated for profit. This system is based on the principles of supply and demand, and it is characterized by competition, innovation, and the freedom of individuals to pursue their own economic interests.

Capitalism is the ideal functional system for our society because it allows for economic freedom and individual initiative. This freedom, leads to innovation and growth, which in turn benefits society as a whole. Additionally, capitalism is seen as a more efficient system than alternatives such as socialism or communism, because it allows market forces to allocate resources in the most efficient way possible.

Furthermore, capitalism is often praised for its ability to create wealth and improve living standards. Because it is based on the pursuit of profit, capitalism incentivizes individuals and businesses to produce goods and services that people want and are willing to pay for. This can lead to increased productivity and a higher standard of living for society as a whole.

According to the principles of egoism, the best possible fitting economic system is capitalism because it is the only proposal which provides a greater good for everyone via selfish means.

Today we do not have an ideal capitalist system by any means. All systems around the world which are characterized as being capitalist, are actually just alternative manifestations of oligarchism masquerading as capitalist societies. True capitalist systems allow free movement of goods and money, and allows every individual to define for themselves what money is and how they wish to use it.

### Bitcoin
> It was the greatest sensation of existence: not to trust but to know. - Ayn Rand

Bitcoin does not fulfill all Randian qualities of what money should be. However, it allows true capitalism to exist. It offers self-sovereignty to each and every human being on earth and allows them to participate on a global, universal even, free market.
