This site is a collection of my resources, small articles, random thoughts, and quick notes on objectivism, technology and economics and the connections between these subjects and ideas. Check out my [newsletter](https://objectivism.substack.com "Objectivism Newsletter by Atrotos, on Substack") on Objectivim.

## Objectivism and Individual Sovereignty
# Why this site?
> I wanted to create a website that harkens back to the early days of the World Wide Web, when the focus was on words and ideas rather than ads, pop-ups, cookie banners, and clickbait. This kind of website allows people to share their ideas and hobbies without any desire or need to profit from them. In today's internet, with its emphasis on modern, polished design and social networking, something important is missing: the ability to express oneself freely without fear of judgment. By using a pseudonym on this site, I can maintain a degree of separation between this place and my other online and offline activities. While the identity behind the pseudonym is not a secret, using it allows me to maintain a degree of anonymity, and that in turn helps enhance freedom of expression in a world where that would otherwise be more difficult. 

## Who is Atrotos?
> "Who is John Galt?" John Galt (/ɡɔːlt/) is a character in Ayn Rand's novel [Atlas Shrugged (1957)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged "Atlas Shrugged Wikipedia"). Although he is not identified by name until the last third of the novel, he is the object of its often-repeated question "Who is John Galt?" and of the quest to discover the answer. Also, in the later part it becomes clear that Galt had been present in the book's plot all along, playing several important roles though not identified by name. ~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Galt "John Galt Wikipedia")

It is not important who I am, and my true identity is not hidden. I use a pen-name online to add character to my online presence. The collections, resources, and notes on this site are for my own benefit, but if you find them helpful or amusing, please feel free to enjoy them.

### What does Atrotos mean?
In the Greek language, the word means "one who is invulnerable". Our universe and everything in it, including the matter and energy that make up our existence, has always existed and will continue to exist in some form or another. This is because matter and energy cannot be destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. Our existence, like the universe itself, is invulnerable to any known force. This should be our understanding of the universe and our place in it. Since something that cannot be destroyed does not need to be explained, our ideas and beliefs about the universe should be grounded in this concept of invulnerability.
